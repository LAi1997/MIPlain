        <p> <br /> First, here are some basics of the game. The Island game is a two-player game. <br />
            The two players, <span style="background-color: #9aeda1">Green</span> and <span style="background-color: #f7cd92">Orange</span>, take turns conquering territories. <br />
            Any untaken territory can be conquered until the game terminates. <br />
            You will play <span style="background-color: #9aeda1">Green</span>. <br />
            </p>

 <div style="clear:both" align="center">
         <p> Conquering a territory provides one or several resources.<br />
            Below is the initial world. Select one territory to get some resources. <br />
