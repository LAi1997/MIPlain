        <p> Do you want to become an expert of the Island game? <br />
            To do so, you will pass a trial which includes 4 parts. <br />
            You will first get familiar with the rules of the game.
            Then you will answer some questions about single moves. <br />
            Next you will become an apprentice of the Great Wizard.
            Finally, you will apply what you have learnt by answering some more questions about single moves.<br />
            <br />
            <br /> First, here are some basics of the game. The Island game is a two-players game. <br />
            The two players, green and orange, take turns conquering territories on the world below. <br />

        <div id="initial" class="center">  </div>
        <script> createBoard2('000000000','initial','Initial World'); </script>


 <div style="clear:both" align="center">
         <p>   You can conquer any untaken territory until the game has not terminated. <br />
            Conquering a territory gives you one or several resources. For instance, conquering the top left territory would give you one Castle and one River. <br />
            Each resource belongs to one of the following category: <br />
            <i> Island 1, Island 2, Island 3, Forest, Castle, Cornfield, River, Animal. </i> <br />
            <br />
            </p>
            </div>

 <div style="clear:both" align="center">
         <p>   A TRIPLET is a collection of three resources of the same category. The player who first succeeds in obtaining a triplet of one category of resource wins the game. One player has a triplet in each the following board states, the territories containing the resources of the triplet are highlighted.
            <br />
            </p>

        createBoard2('211201122', 'triplets','Triplet for Orange: Animal'); 

        </script> <br /> <br />

 <div style="clear:both" align="center">
         <p>   A PAIR is a collection of two resources of the same category for one player, the third resource not being taken yet. One player has one or two pairs in each the following board states, the territories containing the resources of the pairs are highlighted.
            <br />
            </p>

        <div id="pairs" align="center"></div>

        createBoard2('010002010', 'pairs','One pair for Green: Castle');
        createBoard2('210102010', 'pairs','Two pairs for Green: Island 1 and Castle'); 
        createBoard2('200102010', 'pairs','One pair for Orange: River'); 

        </script> <br /> <br />

 <div style="clear:both" align="center">
         <p>   A player could have no TRIPLET nor PAIR. Following examples highlight such cases.
