        <p> Do you want to become an expert of the Island game? <br /> <br />

            To do so, you will pass a trial which includes 4 parts. <br />
            You will first get familiar with the rules of the game. <br />
            Then you will answer some questions about single moves. <br />
            Next you will become an apprentice of the Great Wizard who is a master of the island game. <br />
            Finally, you will apply what you have learnt by answering some more questions about single moves.<br />
            <br />

        <p> <br /> First, here are some basics of the game. The Island game is a two-player game. <br />
            The two players, <span style="background-color: #9aeda1">Green</span> and <span style="background-color: #f7cd92">Orange</span>, take turns conquering territories. <br />
            Any untaken territory can be conquered until the game terminates. <br />
            You will play <span style="background-color: #9aeda1">Green</span>. <br />
            </p>

 <div style="clear:both" align="center">
         <p> <!--Conquering a territory provides one or several resources.<br /> <br /> -->
			There are three islands : <br />
         	<font size="4"> <i> Island 1, Island 2, Island 3. </i> </font> <br /> <br />
			Each island consists of three territories. <br />
			Each territory  can contain one, two or three different resources.<br />
			Resources are: <br />
