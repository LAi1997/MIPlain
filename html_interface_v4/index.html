        <p> Do you want to become an expert of the Island game? <br />
            To do so, you will pass a trial which includes 4 parts. <br />
            You will first get familiar with the rules of the game.
            Then you will answer some questions about single moves. <br />
            Next you will become an apprentice of the Great Wizard.
            Finally, you will apply what you have learnt by answering some more questions about single moves.<br />
            <br />
            <br /> First, here are some basics of the game. The Island game is a two-player game. <br />
            The two players, green and orange, take turns conquering territories on the world below. <br />
            Any untaken territory can be conquered until the game terminates. <br />
            </p>

        <div id="initial" class="center">
            <script> createBoard2('000000000','emptyBoard','initial','Initial World'); </script>
        </div>


 <div style="clear:both" align="center">
         <p> Conquering a territory provides one or several resources. For instance, conquering the top left territory would provide two resources: one Castle and one River. <br />
            Each resource belongs to one of the following category: <br />
            <i> Island 1, Island 2, Island 3, Forest, Castle, Cornfield, River, Animal. </i> <br />
            The player who first succeeds in obtaining three resources of the same category wins the game. <br />
            You can press button at the corner of each board to view the table for resources acquired.

 <div style="clear:both" align="center">
         <p>   A TRIPLET is a collection of three resources of the same category. <br />
            One player has a triplet in each the following board states, the territories containing the resources of the triplet are highlighted.
            <br />
            </p>
            </div>

        createBoard_withtriplet([2,0,2,1,1,1,0,1,2], 'triplet2', 'triplets','Triplet for Green: Cornfield', 1); 
        createBoard_withtriplet([2,1,1,2,0,1,1,2,2], 'triplet3', 'triplets','Triplet for Orange: Animal', 2);

 <div style="clear:both" align="center">
         <p>   A PAIR is a collection of two resources of the same category for one player, the third resource not being taken yet by the opponent. <br />
            One player has one or two pairs in each the following board states, the territories containing the resources of the pairs are highlighted.
            <br />
            </p>
            </div>

        <div id="pairs" align="center"></div>

        <script>

        createBoard_withstrong([0,1,0,0,0,2,0,1,0], 'pair1', 'pairs', 'One pair for Green: Castle', 1);
        createBoard_withstrong([2,1,0,1,0,2,0,1,0], 'pair2', 'pairs', 'Two pairs for Green: Island 1 and Castle', 1);
        createBoard_withstrong([2,0,0,1,0,2,0,1,0], 'pair3', 'pairs', 'One pair for Orange: River', 2);

        </script> <br /> <br />

 <div style="clear:both" align="center">
         <p>   A player could have no TRIPLET nor PAIR. Following examples highlight such cases.

        <div id="other" align="center"></div>

        <script>
        createBoard2('110000122', 'no1', 'other','Orange has no pair nor triplet');
