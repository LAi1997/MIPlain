        <p> Do you want to become an expert of the Island game? <br /> <br />

            To do so, you will pass a trial which includes 4 parts. <br />
            You will first get familiar with the rules of the game. <br />
            Then you will answer some questions about single moves. <br />
            Next you will become an apprentice of the Great Wizard who is a master of the island game. <br />
            Finally, you will apply what you have learnt by answering some more questions about single moves.<br />

        <p> First, here are some basics of the game. <br />
            The game is played on the board below. There are three islands: <br />
            <font size="4"> <i> Island 1, Island 2, Island 3. </i> </font> <br />

            Each island consists of three territories. <br />
            Each territory  can contain one, two or three different resources. Resources are: <br />
            <font size="4"> <i>  Forest, Castle, Cornfield, River, Fish. </i> </font> <br />  <br /> 
            </p>
    </div>

        </script>
        </div>
    </div>

        <div align="center">

        <p> Any untaken territory can be conquered until the game terminates. <br />
            For a given constellation of islands, you can capture some resources by clicking on a territory containing them. <br />
            <u>Select one territory (white cell) on the board above to capture some resources.</u> <br /> <br /> <br />
